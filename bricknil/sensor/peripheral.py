    """Abstract base class for any Lego Boost/PoweredUp/WeDo peripherals

       A LEGO sensor can provide either a single_ sensing capability, or a combined_  mode where it returns multiple
       sensing values.  All the details can be found in the official protocol description.

       * **Single capability** - This is the easiest to handle:
            * Send a 0x41 Port Input Format Setup command to put the sensor port into the respective mode and activate updates
            * Read back the 0x45 Port Value(Single) messages with updates from the sensor on the respective mode
       * **Multiple capabilities** - This is more complicated because we need to put the sensor port into CombinedMode
            * Send a [0x42, port, 0x02] message to lock the port
            * Send multiple 0x41 messages to activate each capability/mode we want updates from
            * Send a [0x42, port, 0x01, ..] message with the following bytes:
                * 0x00 = Row entry 0 in the supported combination mode table
                    (hard-coded for simplicity here because LEGO seems to only use this entry most of the time)
                * For each mode/capability, send a byte like the following:
                    * Upper 4-bits is mode number
                    * Lower 4-bits is the dataset number
                    * For example, for getting RGB values, it's mode 6, and we want all three datasets
                        (for each color), so we'd add three bytes [0x60, 0x61, 0x62].
                        If you just wanted the Red value, you just append [0x60]
            * Send a [0x42, port, 0x03] message to unlock the port
            * Now, when the sensor sends back values, it uses 0x46 messages with the following byte sequence:
                * Port id
                * 16-bit entry where the true bits mark which mode has values included in this message
                    (So 0x00 0x05 means values from Modes 2 and 0)
                * Then the set of values from the sensor, which are ordered by Mode number
                    (so the sensor reading from mode 0 would come before the reading from mode 2)
                * Each set of values includes however many bytes are needed to represent each dataset
                    (for example, up to 3 for RGB colors), and the byte-width of each value (4 bytes for a 32-bit int)
